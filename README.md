# Getting started

I'm using Python in PyCharm to solve these puzzles, here's a quick guide to get this up and running.<br>

Download and install:<BR>
  PyCharm community edition https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/<BR>
  Python 3.10 https://www.python.org/downloads/<BR>


Follow the steps in this guide:<BR>

# Trying it out

Don't forget to register on the AoC page to be able to get your personal input data and submit your results. To get part 2 you need to solve part 1 first.<br>
You can use my 00_solution.py as a start for each day, it contains the basics for each solution.<br>
Save the input files in the format xx_input.txt in the same directory as the xx_solution.py files.<br>
Toggle the variable 'simple' from True to False to easily switch from the short examples to the real input data.<br>
I usually do a lot of print() debugging to see what the program does. To control the amount of chatter I set the 'verbose' variable to a number from 0 to ~3 and this is checked before each print statement to set the noise level.<br>
  
Give the previous years calendar a shot if you are waiting for Dec 1, they are available the other months of the year, or if you sponsor the project as AoC++.<br>
